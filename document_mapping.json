Purpose and Context \nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR USERS: The PLM Portal web-based eAF is now open for all types of variation \napplications for all products, including those authorised through purely national procedures (NP), mutual \nrecognition procedure (MRP) and decentralised procedure (DCP). The use of the web based eAF for non-\ncentrally Authorised products (non-CAPs) submissions to the NCAs is recommended from 26th May 2025. \nPlease note that is strongly recommended to use the web based eAF for Centralised Procedure \napplications. It is also possible and recommended to use the web based eAF for mixed CAP/non-CAP \nEMA-led worksharing applications. \nWe very strongly encourage the non-CAP MAHs to use this period of time to familiarise themselves \nwith the system and start using the web-based form, where possible,  instead of the interactive pdf eAF. \nWe invite all users to pay attention if there are any issues in the new web based eAF that would prevent \nthe use of the form in any scenarios. Please provide the feedback on change requests and issues to EMA \nin a consolidated way (ideally through industry associations) via the EMA service desk.  \nIf you are using the web-based form and you have an issue, please report these through the service \ndesk.  \n1.1. \nPurpose of this guide \nThis guide aims to support the users of the PLM Portal - eAF in navigating through the platform. More \nspecifically, the guide has been produced to show users how to access the PLM Portal - eAF, as well as \nprepare application forms. \nPlease note that this guide is a living document which will be updated regularly. It describes some \nissues in the form functionality and aims to provide workaround solutions. Please refer to the user guide \nbefore raising questions via the Service Desk as your question may already be addressed in this \nguidance. \nPlease note that, although this version is updated this is still an early version of this guide \nand it may contain errors and incomplete information. \n1.2. \nPreliminary requirements \nTo access the PLM Portal eAF all users are required to have: \n\u25aa \nan active EMA user account, and, \n\u25aa \nuser access role(s) assigned to that account. \nRegistration needs to be done only once. For information on how to request an EMA account and how to \nan appropriate PLM Portal - eAF role (these are two separate actions), please consult the separate PLM \nPortal - eAF - Guide to Registration document. \n1.3. \nSupported Browsers \nThe PLM Portal - eAF can be accessed on any modern Web Browser, including but has only been tested \nwith Google Chrome (latest version) and Edge (including the new, Chromium-based Edge). No official \ntesting has been done using other browsers, such as Safari 12 and above, Firefox (latest version), Vivaldi, \netc."

Please note that the product selection is on \u2018Medicinal Product\u2019 level i.e. if the product \nselected has for example more than 1 pharmaceutical forms, and your change impacts all \n\u2018medicinal products\u2019 you should select them all, but this does not mean that the work-sharing \ntick box will be ticked."

While posts are visible to everyone, users need to be logged in \nto the portal to create a new thread or reply to an existing one. \nEMA staff may intervene in the forums, but replies to individual questions cannot be guaranteed, as the \nforum does not replace the established EMA communication channels: \n1. EMA Service Desk for questions on the use of the portal and for reporting faults; \n2. EMA Account Management for access and registration requests;"
